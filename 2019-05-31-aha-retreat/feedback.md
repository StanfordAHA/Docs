# CoreIR
* Possibility of creating FPGA backends for CoreIR (Xilinx)

# Magma
* How do you optimize the *debug time* (most important) (Nafea)
* How do you give feedback on long timing paths, power etc? For example, how to map results from static timing analysis back to lines of code in magma? (Apple, Brucek)
* Want to use magma and passes for an internal project (Brucek)

# DSLs
* Yet another DSL? What is the benefit? Now I have to train my engineers on another DSL? (Xilinx)

# Architecture
* Want to see more architectural exploration, complex PE, custom accelerators (Sophia)

# Halide to hardware 
* Bfloat16 works for ML but not for imaging. Using Halide bounds tool to convert into integer. (Andrew)

* How to incorporate reliability into the framework (Nafea)
* What is the interrupt strategy
